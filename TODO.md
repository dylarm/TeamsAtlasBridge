* SIGN WINDOWS EXE (macOS dmg?) (added 2020-10-20)
    * Update 2020-10-24: Appears to be a mostly-pointless endeavor. Without spending the ~$400 for an Extended Validity certificate, it is only possible to self-sign, which might be no different than now. Will need to test.
* (!) Teams allows exporting of all grades for entire section -- allow for splitting, etc. (added 2020-10-21)
    * Currently it _should_ only load the first/latest assignment. At least, it does with my test data
    * According to Paul Scott on FB, it is force quitting with their test data
    * Should the multiple files be output in a subdirectory, or just wherever the output single output file would go?
    * How to automatically detect that the file loaded contains multiple assignments vs just one?
* Allow for scaling of grade - percentage (added 2020-10-20)
* Allow changing of output file name - default vs custom? (added 2020-10-20)
    * Will need to allow for notification of possibly overwriting currently existing file
